Feature 1 & 2: Poll mentor Google Calendars every 10 minutes.
When a call with a Spark is detected as just ended, post a nudge in the
Spark's thread on #proj-redesign-spark tagging the mentor(s) on the call.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
NOTE: WHY THIS NEEDS ITS OWN GOOGLE SETUP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
During development, Claude used a Google MCP tool connected to Jainam's
personal Google account — this allowed Claude to read Jainam's Gmail to
find Spark emails, etc. That MCP is a developer tool only, NOT how
calendar_walker.py works.

calendar_walker.py needs to read OTHER people's calendars (mentors across
the org). Jainam's personal Google credentials cannot do this. It requires
a Google service account with domain-wide delegation — a server credential
issued by IT that is allowed to impersonate any RH Google Workspace user
and read their calendar. This has never run yet and is blocked on IT setup.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IT SETUP REQUIRED (one-time, via #helpdesk)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  1. Create a Google service account (or use an existing one) and download
     its JSON key — paste the entire JSON as the env var GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON
     on Dokploy.

  2. In Google Workspace Admin Console → Security → API Controls →
     Domain-wide Delegation → Add the service account's client ID with scope:
       https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly

  3. Set env var GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_USER to any RH admin email
     (e.g. jainam.chudgar@redesignhealth.com) — the service account will
     impersonate this user as the entry point to access mentor calendars.

Without steps 1-3, check_calendars() will skip silently on every poll.
